# Understanding Type I Error in Statistical Analysis

## Basic Concepts
Here I assume the reader is familiar with the basic concpets of Hypothesis Testing and will not go through it. However, I will present a definition or interpretation for the most important ones, to make sure we are on the same page before jumping ahead and making conclusions based on them.


* $ \alpha $: the significance level
The probability of rejecting a Null Hypothesis, $H_0$, when $H_0$ is actually true!

* $p$-value:
In $A/B$ testing, the p-value is the probability that we would get the observed difference between the A and B groups (or a more extreme difference) by random chance.
